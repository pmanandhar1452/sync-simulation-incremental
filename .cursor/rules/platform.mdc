## Platform Choices

The following rules establish choices for the runtime, framework, or any
additional build steps.

- Utilize the Deno runtime for simplified tooling and imports. Prefer to use
  generic imports without version numbers to reliably import libraries.
- To the greatest extent possible, only implement application logic as
  synchronizations, and organize them under the `syncs/` folder. You may use
  whatever sub-file/folder structure that helps keep things clear, but remember
  to register all synchronizations with the same engine.
